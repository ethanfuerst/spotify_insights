# spotify_insights

My mission for this project is to visualize my Spotify data in multiple ways. I'm interested to see how long I spent listening to my top songs, and how my listening changed between each year. I'd like to do something like [this project I found](https://github.com/luka1199/geo-heatmap) where people can download their own data and visualize it with my code. I think I will use Plotly and Dash to create interactive dashboards.

## Files in this repository

### .py

__*create_data.py*__ - takes data from the MyData folder in get_stream_data() and creates .csv files

__*streams_viz.py*__ - uses data from get_stream_data() and creates plotly visualizations

#### .csv

__*streams.csv*__ - cleaned streams data from create_data.py

__*streams_tracks/tracks_days/days/artists_days.csv*__ - cleaned streams data in assorted groupings from create_data.py

## TODO

- [x] add weekday column to streams
- [x] change create_data.py to method that returns dataframe of cleaned streams (with dtypes)
- [ ] brainstorm big picture idea
  - [ ] brainstorm vizs on plotly
- [ ] learn more about [Spotify Developer API](https://developer.spotify.com/)
- [ ] make script to compare two diffrent users streaming data (maybe another repo)
