# spotifyinsights

My mission for this project is to visualize my Spotify data in multiple ways. I'm interested to see how long I spent listening to my top songs, and how my listening changed between each year. I'd like to do something like [this project I found](https://github.com/luka1199/geo-heatmap) where people can download their own data and visualize it with my code. I think I will use Plotly and Dash to create interactive dashboards.

I'll be working on this project this winter, starting again after I take my finals!

**Files in this repository:**

*create_data.py* - .py file that takes data from the MyData folder and creates dataframes. I could add the rest of my code on to here or I could figure out how to take the dataframes directly in to another file where I will create the dashboards.

*.gitignore* - shows github what files to ignore when I commit my changes.

**TODO:**

- [ ] learn more about Plotly and Dash

- [ ] figure out how to clean all the data and what format I will use the dataframes for
